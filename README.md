# Development Environment Control Script

Simply dev env control script writen in BASH

## Objective

You may be tired of executing the same sentences in order, over and over again, to perform the same task.

The `devcontrol` script can help by calling your set of scripts that automate these tasks, such as starting or stopping services, loading initial data, putting everything together in a single dynamic management interface and allowing you to keep the focus on your development work.

## Installation

Open a console and execute:

```shell
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/teecke/devcontrol/master/install.sh | sudo bash
```

The `devcontrol` script will be installed in your `/usr/local/bin` directory.

## Create actions

You can add actions to your repository. Simply put one or more bash script files under the `devcontrol/actions` directory of your `git` repository with the `.sh` extension. Then execute `devcontrol` at the root of the repository.

In details:

1. Create a directory called `devcontrol/actions` at the root directory of your `git` repository and put whithin your action scripts (one bash script file per action, with the `.sh` extension).
2. Optionally, create another directory called `devcontrol/global` and put a bash script called `startup.sh` with your initialization variables and global functions.
3. Execute the `devcontrol` script in the root folder of your project.

The `devcontrol` script will collect the whole of your action scripts and put enable you to execute as parametrized options of the `devcontrol` script.

Find an example under `examples/docker` folder. Is a set of scripts to manage project driven by docker-compose.

Usage:
    - bin/devcontrol.sh help     # This information page
    - bin/devcontrol.sh destroy  # Environment removal
    - bin/devcontrol.sh enter    # Enter with a console to a service: 'app' (default), 'db' or 'duing'
    - bin/devcontrol.sh logs     # Show logs
    - bin/devcontrol.sh start    # Environment start and load initial data
    - bin/devcontrol.sh status   # Get status of the local docker development environment
    - bin/devcontrol.sh stop     # Platform stop

Use 'bin/devcontrol.sh help <action>' to display his help (e.g. bin/devcontrol.sh help destroy)

$ bin/devcontrol.sh help status

## Action scripts format

The `devcontrol` script will call your scripts with at least one parameter identified in the $1 variable within your script and one of the following texts:

- `brief`: Expect that the script will display one line with a summary exmplanation of the comand. It will be used in the action list (`devcontrol help`)
- `help`: Expect a multiline explanation. It will be used with the (`devcontrol help <action>`)
- `exec`: The statements of the action (`devcontrol <action>`). The script will receive parameters from the `devcontrol` script.

Take a look at the example actions under `examples/docker/actions` folder. Feel free to add your own examples as pull request to this project.

## Startup script format

It's up to you. It will be executed first, so you can put here the title of your project.

## Debug

Execute the script with `DC_DEBUG=1 devcontrol status` to help trace errors.

```console
$ DC_DEBUG=1 bin/devcontrol.sh
>>>> DEBUG >>>>> 2019-08-24 19:32:31 devcontrol: begin
>>>> DEBUG >>>>> 2019-08-24 19:32:31 devcontrol: Devcontrol (c) Teecke 2019
